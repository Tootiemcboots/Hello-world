# Hello-world

Hello, Im currently going through this tutorial to figure out how to code. I am definetly getting my butt kicked at the moment becuse it is taking me too long to figure it out. I am getting fustrated with myslef and feel like dropping out of school again. This is one of my weaknesses and I hope to overcome this obstacle.
